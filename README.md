# 🪪 OCR + YOLOv8-based Smart ID Recognition and Auto-Fill System

This project detects and recognizes fields from scanned identity cards (like passports) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and EasyOCR. It performs:

- 📦 Image region detection (YOLO)
- 🧠 Text recognition (EasyOCR)
- 🔈 Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for key regions
- 📝 Field normalization and cleaning
- 🧾 Optional auto-filling of Google Forms using Selenium

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the files into a folder.

2. Setup Python environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖼️ Usage

### 1. `imgid_folder.py`: Bulk ID image processing

- Processes **all `.jpg/.png/.jpeg` images** inside a folder.
- Creates two output folders:
  - `final_outputs/`: Boxes and OCR results for class 0,1,2
  - `idcard_outputs/`: Full OCR + labeled fields (class 3+)

#### ✅ Steps:

```bash
python imgid_folder.py
```

🛠 Modify this line inside the code with your input folder path:

```python
image_input_path = r"C:\Users\<your_username>\path\to\your\images"
```

---

### 2. `imgid_final.py`: Single image + Google Form fill

- Processes **one image**
- Extracts fields
- Converts class 0/1/2 text to audio
- Asks user if they want to auto-fill a Google Form

#### ✅ Steps:

```bash
python imgid_final.py
```

🛠 Make sure this line is correct in code:

```python
image_input_path = "image.png"
```

💡 You will be prompted:

```
📨 Do you want to fill a Google Form? (yes/no):
🔗 Paste Google Form URL:
```

If `yes`, the program uses Selenium to fill it based on detected fields.

## 🧠 What the Code Does

### Detection and OCR
- Loads `mymodel.pt` (custom-trained YOLOv8 model)
- Detects bounding boxes for 18 field classes
- Applies EasyOCR to extract text from each region

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- For class 0/1/2 (general text fields), detected text is converted to speech via `gTTS`, saved as `audio.mp3`

### Field Cleaning & Normalization
- Removes OCR noise, matches fields to standardized names
- Handles fuzzy logic and alias mapping (e.g., `DOB`, `Date ofbimn` → `Date of Birth`)

### Google Form Automation (only in `imgid_final.py`)
- Uses Selenium WebDriver
- Opens Google Form
- Matches field labels using alias mapping + fuzzy matching
- Enters detected data automatically

---

## 📥 Input Types

- Accepts image files: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- Either:
  - Place images in folder (for `imgid_folder.py`)
  - OR define path to a single image (for `imgid_final.py`)

---

## 📤 Output

- `final_outputs/` – Class 0,1,2 cropped OCR results (e.g., photo region, signature, etc.)
- `idcard_outputs/` – Field-detected full image and text (e.g., `Name`, `Passport No`, etc.)
- `data.txt` – Final structured field info (used by `imgid_final.py`)
- `audio.mp3` – Spoken version of text from class 0/1/2

---

## 🛠 Notes

- `mymodel.pt` must be trained on 18 ID field classes using Ultralytics YOLOv8
- For form filling, you need:
  - Chrome browser installed
  - Compatible ChromeDriver version
- Form field matching uses fuzzy logic with aliases for high accuracy

---

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
A scanned passport image.

### Output:
```
Surname: Sharma
Name: Raj
Date of Birth: 01/01/2000
Passport No: X1234567
Nationality: Indian
```

🟢 Audio: `Raj Sharma X1234567 One January Two Thousand`

📋 Google Form: Automatically filled and shown for review.
